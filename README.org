*** Hi! I'm Raiden.
I'm a passionate learner and love to combine art, math, and programming. I'm always exploring new technologies and finding new interests.

I work as a Software Engineer for the [[https://cdlib.org][California Digital Library]] building Zephir, the MARC metadata ingest and management system for the 18 million items in the [[https://hathitrust.org][HathiTrust Digital Library]]. I also develop and train machine learning models for library applications such as entity matching, metadata remediation, and accessibility improvements.

**** Areas of Interest (in no particular order)
- Machine Learning
- Computer Graphics
- Natural simulations (plant growth, land formation)
- MARC Cataloging
- Typography
