I love to combine art, math, and programming, and am always finding new things to learn and projects to start in my free time.

I work as a Software Engineer for the [[https://cdlib.org][California Digital Library]] building Zephir, the MARC metadata ingest and management system for the 18 million items in the [[https://hathitrust.org][HathiTrust Digital Library]], as well as machine learning projects for metadata remediation and accessibility.
